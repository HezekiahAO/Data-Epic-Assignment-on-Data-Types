Git helps keep track of the change that has been made. 
    Since it keeps track of a change, you can go back to the beginning of the code and change something.
    Git is a Version Control system : ie keeps track of your diferent cahnges.
    Git is the tool that keeps track of your code changes while GitHub is a code repository, where you host all this changes


    git push is used to push your new codes to git hub.  the new commites.


    most times, when you start a project you have to be the one who will initialize git.
    this can be done using the command                    git init                   which basically initialize the folder.

    Git Status command shows what is going on in a file basically the commit that has been made.

     It tells you: what is in your notebook.

Changes that have been staged (ready to be committed).
Changes that are not staged (modified but not yet added for commit).
Untracked files (new files that haven't been added to version control yet).
The current branch you are on and whether it's ahead/behind the remote branch.

git add is like you are adding something to you note book.




Git init        

How to add a file to your GitHub repository.

    git add "name of the file you want to add"
    git commit -m "name of the file you want to add also"
    git push origin main

and that does it
and if you want to remove a file 
    
    git rm --cached "file-you-want-to-remove"

does it.
